Spam Email Classification Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for classifying emails as spam or not spam. Using a labeled dataset, applied several popular classifiers:

- Decision Tree Classifier
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- K-Neighbors Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
  
Each model was evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The SVC achieved the highest accuracy at 99.4%,
with K-Neighbors and Logistic Regression closely following. Confusion matrices and classification reports for each model provide insights into their performance.
