**Spam Email Classification Model**

This ML PROJECT is about machine learning model for classifying emails as spam or not spam. Using a labeled dataset, applied several popular classifiers:

- Decision Tree Classifier
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- K-Neighbors Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
  
Each model was evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The SVC achieved the highest accuracy at 99.4%,
with K-Neighbors and Logistic Regression closely following. Confusion matrices and classification reports for each model provide insights into their performance.

**Heart Disease Prediction Model**

This ML PROJECT is about machine learning model for Heart Disease Prediction. Using a labeled dataset, applied several popular classifiers:

- Decision Tree Classifier
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- K-Neighbors Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- MLPClassifier
- GradientBoostingClassifier
- AdaBoostClassifier
- XGBClassifier

Based on the accuracy scores and the classification report metrics, Logistic Regression (logreg) is the best model with an accuracy of 0.91, 
high precision, recall, and F1-score across both classes, indicating strong performance and balance in handling the dataset.
